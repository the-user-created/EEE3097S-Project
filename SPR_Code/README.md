# Second progress report code

EEE3097S_Project is the entire project from STM32CubeIDE

stm_handler.py was used for transmitting/receiving data from the STM

grapher.py was used for graphing the encryption/decryption speeds and compression/decompression speeds

imu_test.py was used for gathering sensor data in real time

CLion contains all the C code used for testing the algorithms in a non-STM environment
